# DnDProject

I am creating an Interactive DND Character Sheet application, as a part of my CodeCademy journey.

This will act as a porfolio project showcasing;
HTML / CSS / JavaScript / React / Redux / Jest / React-Testing-Library / WireFraming

Goals: 
Be able to input data into the web app
Be able to interact with the app assist me to 'play' DnD (Roll multiple dice etc) 

I will be acheiving these goals using agile and TDD methodoloies, I will be using a Trello to 
plan and modulate this project as it unfolds;
